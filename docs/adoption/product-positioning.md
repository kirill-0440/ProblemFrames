# Product Positioning: ProblemFrames

## Target ICP

Primary teams:

- safety- or correctness-sensitive product teams
- architecture/reliability leads who need reviewable requirement-to-design traceability

Secondary teams:

- systems with dense domain/interface boundaries
- organizations under formal review/compliance pressure

## Problem We Solve

Teams lose requirement intent when they jump into solution design too early.
This creates avoidable review churn, late requirement conflicts, and weak traceability.

## Core Value Proposition

ProblemFrames provides:

- explicit world/machine boundary modeling
- machine-checkable PF invariants and frame-fit constraints
- editor-integrated diagnostics (LSP)
- deterministic evidence artifacts for CI and architecture reviews

## Competitive Framing

ProblemFrames is not another diagram editor.
It is a quality control loop for requirement semantics and traceable downstream artifacts.

## Success Signal

For pilot teams, the first measurable outcome is reduced review iterations caused by unclear or conflicting requirements.
