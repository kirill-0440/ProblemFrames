# Dogfooding Decomposition Closure Reports

This directory stores generated decomposition closure snapshots from PF dogfooding models.

Use the generator script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/generate_decomposition_reports.sh
```

In CI, decomposition closure reports are generated into `.ci-artifacts/dogfooding-decomposition` and published as workflow artifacts.
