# Dogfooding Obligations

This directory stores generated proof-obligation snapshots from PF dogfooding models.

Use the generator script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/generate_obligation_reports.sh
```

In CI, obligation reports are generated into `.ci-artifacts/dogfooding-obligations` and published as workflow artifacts.
