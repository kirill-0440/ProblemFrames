# Proposals

This directory contains product and engineering proposals for Problem Frames.

## Active Drafts

- `001-product-maturity-roadmap.md`: 90-day maturity plan from quality gates to release readiness.
- `002-formal-verification-track.md`: Parallel formal methods track (Lean first, K optional) without blocking the main Rust workflow.
- `003-adoption-and-gtm.md`: ICP, adoption path, and proof-of-value plan for real teams.
- `004-lean-integration-proposal.md`: Lean 4 integration details (semantics, transpilation, and phased rollout).
- `005-v0.2.0-scope-and-exit-criteria.md`: scoped `v0.2.0` plan with product goals, formal spike, and concrete exit criteria.
- `006-pf-dsl-machine-checkable-semantics-plan.md`: phased execution plan for PF metamodel hardening, static semantics, `W/S/R` obligations, and first formal backend integration.
- `007-paper-aligned-roadmap-adaptation.md`: paper-driven roadmap adaptation layered over proposals `005` and `006`, prioritizing traceability, formal obligation checking, PF-to-design bridge, and rationale capture.
- `007-execution-backlog-m1-m3.md`: execution-ready issue/checklist backlog for milestone group `M1-M3` from proposal `007`.
- `008-pf-ddd-sysmlv2-integration.md`: integration track for extending PF-DSL from CIM authority to DDD and SysML v2 PIM outputs with mandatory transformation traces.
- `008-execution-backlog-m4-m5.md`: execution-ready backlog for proposal `008` milestones (`M4a-M5a`) across marks, generators, trace contracts, and API spike.
