# Proposal 005: v0.2.0 Scope and Exit Criteria

## Status

Draft

## Planning Window

- Start: February 13, 2026
- Target release cut: April 30, 2026

## Objective

Define a focused `v0.2.0` scope that improves product reliability and planning maturity without overloading the release.

## Scope Summary

`v0.2.0` includes three product goals and one formal-methods spike.

### Product Goal 1: Release Reliability as a Merge-Time Contract

- Keep release workflow guardrails checked on pull requests, not only on tag builds.
- Enforce stable release bundle quality (`SHA256SUMS`, SBOM quality checks, provenance bundles).
- Keep platform policy explicit (Linux/macOS supported, Windows status documented and gated).

Exit criteria:

- Two consecutive release tags complete successfully with full security metadata.
- No release incident caused by missing workflow wiring/config.

### Product Goal 2: Dogfooding-Driven Planning Loop

- Use PF dogfooding models as planning artifacts, not just examples.
- Generate a weekly Markdown report that maps model findings to prioritized actions.
- Track owner + due date for top actions in the weekly triage issue.

Exit criteria:

- Two weekly triage cycles use generated dogfooding outputs as primary input.
- Each cycle closes or re-plans at least one top-priority dogfooding action.

### Product Goal 3: Validator and LSP Quality Tightening

- Improve confidence in diagnostics stability for unsaved-buffer and definition flows.
- Extend integration fixtures for high-value failure modes (missing refs, frame misuse, command origin issues).
- Keep CI signal quality high (low flaky rate, clear failing checks).

Exit criteria:

- Add at least three new integration/semantic fixtures that catch prior blind spots.
- Keep `main` red rate below 5% during the milestone window.

### Formal Spike: Lean/K Feasibility Check (Research Track)

- Keep Rust validator as production path.
- Deliver one end-to-end formal artifact for a real PF model:
  - generated Lean model from PF AST
  - one non-trivial proved property
  - differential result compared with Rust validator
- K Framework remains optional and limited to one scoped experiment if capacity allows.

Exit criteria:

- One documented proof case runs in CI (non-blocking).
- One short decision memo recommends next step: continue Lean-first, pause, or expand to K experiment.

## Out of Scope for v0.2.0

- Replacing Rust validator with theorem proving on the LSP path.
- Broad DSL redesign or syntax overhaul.
- Full enterprise governance/compliance feature set.

## Risks and Mitigations

- Risk: Scope creep across product + formal tracks.
  - Mitigation: Enforce exit criteria as the only release gate for this milestone.
- Risk: CI latency increase.
  - Mitigation: Keep formal checks non-blocking and path-scoped.
- Risk: Planning artifacts become stale.
  - Mitigation: Tie dogfooding output directly to weekly triage issue template.

## Decision Needed

Approve this scope as the default plan for `v0.2.0`.
