# Formal Backend Artifacts

This directory stores snapshots and summaries from the non-blocking Alloy backend translator stage.

Generate artifacts locally:

```bash
bash ./scripts/run_formal_backend_check.sh
```

In CI, artifacts are generated into `.ci-artifacts/formal-backend` and uploaded as `formal-backend`.
